// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers



PRINT "Add two numbers together to calculate the sum of those numbers."

	(Input n1

	Input n2

		Set SUM = n1 + n2

			Output SUM)

--END--

-----------------------------------------------

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd



PRINT "If the remainder when dividing a number by 2 is zero, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd."

	(Input number

		IF number modulo 2 equals 0, then
			output "Number is even."

		ELSE
			output "Number is odd.")

--END--

// Exercise 3: Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

	a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
	b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
	c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
	d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are.



PRINT "When any 5 numbers are input, this pseudocode will calculate the average of those 5 numbers, and using conditional statements within an iteration, will identify the smallest and the largest of the input numbers. The results of these calculations will be displayed upon conclusion."

	(input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

		{avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5}

			[small = n1
			large = n1
			for i = 2 to 5:

   				IF n1 > ni, then:
       				small = ni

				IF n1 < ni, then:
				large = ni]

		PRINT("Average:", avg)

		PRINT("Smallest:", small)

		PRINT("Largest:", large))
